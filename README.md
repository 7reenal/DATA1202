# PROJECT TITLE 
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

# Description
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment to aid in early detection and management of diabetes.
# Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

Python (3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
# Installing
Follow these steps to get a development environment running:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.
Run the notebook or Python script.

# Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

Break down into end to end tests
These tests validate the performance of the trained model on unseen data. They assess metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
python test_model.py

# Deployment
For deploying this model on a live system, you can use various deployment platforms like Flask, Django, or cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
